## Description
This project uses the MSP430G2553 and the MSP430F5529 to blink two LEDs at different frequencies.
## Files
The files for each of the microcontrollers can be found in the folders with their respective names. The file containing the code is named blink.c.
## Execution
To run this code on your microcontroller, create a project in Code Composer Studio. Make sure to choose the microcontroller that you own when creating the project. I used CCS 8.2.0 to do this. Add this file to your project. This can be done by browsing for the file or just by copying and pasting the contents of the file into a new file. Plug in your microcontroller. Begin to debug your code and update any firmware if necessary. The debugger will finish flashing your code and it will automatically pause at the first line of code. Press the green play button and the code will now be running on your microcontroller.
